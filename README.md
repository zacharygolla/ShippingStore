# ShippingStore
This project was done for Texas State University's OOP class. The focus of the project was to create a GUI for the shipping store assignment done in assignment 3. The grader of the course had rewritten the assignment from assignment 3 so that it could be used as a standard for all GUI's across the class. It was completed with my partner Kentessa Fanfair-Goldestein.
